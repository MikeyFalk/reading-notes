Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers or a JavaScript runtime

It is recomended to use a version manager to download node.js whihc allows you to set a node version on a pre-project basis and reduces chances of a permissions issues when using Node with npm.

you can check that Node.js is installed by typing node -v

create a file callse hello.ks and type 
`console.log("Hello, World");`

If Hello World is displayed it is installed correctly

Node.js works well with modern JS
if you run npm -v you will see which version of npm is installed. 

npm is the pacakage manager for JS

There are also over 1M pacakages available with npm.

`npm install -g jshint` will install jshint pacakage and can be used to lint js files.

`npm init -y` will install and auto-populate a `package.json` file

`npm install lodash --save` will install a lodash package as a project dependency

pacakage.json file

the test directory has a folder called node_modules where lodash is saves and any libraries that lodash depends on. these shouldn't be sent to git by keeping the dependencies in the json file any developer will be able to clone your project and install the correct packages it need with npm.

Node.js is used to automate the process of developing modern JS applications. 

React and Angular rely on Node to create a development enviroment to run.

Node.js allows us to run JS on the server and first to gain wide traction

Node is faster than Appache because it is event driven instead of loading the code in blocks.

Downside of single thread blocking I/O calls should be avoided and errors not handled correctly can crash the entire process.

Node is great for buildign applications that require  real-time interaction or collaboration and APIs for handling lots of requests, or data streaming because it is more real time.

Express is the best framework to use with Node

## Advantages of Node

speed and scalability and you brain doesn't need to switch modes when working wiht backend becasue it all uses JS.

Node speaks JSON - most important data exchange format on the web

Also Node can be used to create your own robots!!!
