# Read: 07 - Interfaces

## Interfaces: 

Interfaces in C# are like abstract classes. They cannot be instantiated themselves and like an abstract class pass "requirement" methods to classes that implement the interface.

Unlike abstract classes a class can implement multiple interfaces. A class can also inherit a base class and implement one or more interfaces.

A good example of an interface would be a driver. A driver interface could work with a car, boat, motorcycle, suv, truck or bulldozer class.
