## Intro to Identity
ASP.NET Core Identity is a system that adds login functionality to apps.

Login can be stored in Identity or an external login provide can be used like Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, or Twitter

The steps to use Identity are:

1. Create a Web app with authentication
2. Apply migrations
3. Test Register and Login
4. View the identity database
5. Configure Identity Services
6. Scaffold Register, Login, and LogOut
7. Examine Register
8. Log in
9. Log out
10. Test Identity

## Identity Demystified

Identity has three parts 
1. Claims -  a single fact about the user (DOB on a drivers license). These are represented by the Claim class and the constructor accepts type and value strings parameters
2. ClaimsIdentity -  a single way of proving who you are like a drivers license. Can be authenticated or not. To be authenticated you have to set the `AuthenticationType` which will set the  `IsAuthenticated` property to `true`. A claimsIdentity can contain many claims about at a user  
3. Claims Principal - the principal represents the actual user. It can contain one or more instances of ClaimsIdentity. Like a person who has a library card, passport and drivers license.

Commands and Behaviors of the auth system,
Authenticate - gets user's info
Challenge - requests authentication by user
SignIn - persists the user's info somewhere
SignOut - Removes the user's persisted information 
Forbid - Denies access to a resource for unauthenticated users or authenticated and unauthorized users

use `app.UseAuthentication();` in the Configure code block in startup.CS  
and register the service in the ConfigurationServices code block with `services.AppAuthentication()` to add authentication middleware

Don't forget to also include an `applicationUser` class to model the user and reference the username and password
You'll also need an accountController to handle the authentication pieces like signing in and
signing out.
