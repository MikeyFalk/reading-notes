## CSS Animations

CSS3 has new ways to position and alter elements with the `transform` property

`transform` has two settings 2D and 3D.

`transform` uses a vendor pre-fix to get the best performance based on the browser.

`rotate` property will rotate an element

`scale` can be used to change the appeared size of an element

`translate` will move an element in different directions

`skew` distort elements on the horizontal, vertical or both axis

multiple transformations are possible but must be made in the same property one after the other.

`perspective` - vanishing point for 3D drawings

3d objects can be can be rotated with `rotateX`, `rotateY`, and `rotateZ`.

`ScaleZ` can scale 3d objects on the z axis

Fade In - coded in 2 steps 1st set the initial state then set the change on hover. 

Change color - `.color:hover` super easy

Grow and Shrink -  `.grow:hover` to grow and `.shrink:hover`
Rotate elements - `.rotate:hover`
Square to Circle - `.circle:hover`
3D shadow - `.threed:hover`
swing is a bit more complex
inset border - `.border:hover`
