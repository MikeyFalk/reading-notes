## Google Teams

- Google wanted to know how great teams worked they spent money and time evaluating great teams and found that just having high performers wasn't an indicator of success.
- Great teams had members of all abilities that shared unwritten intangible rules 
- These rules include mutual respect and psychological safety 
- Psychological safety means that people felt safe to make mistakes and be themselves
- Additionally it is important to have clear goals and a feedback group
- its important to build these teams because we often spend more time at work than with our families.

- This article uses a dialog to describe a high level model of how the internet works.
1. The internet is just servers sending data back and forth to each other
2. It was difficult to do this because different servers and data are in different languages and formats
3. Coders use the concept of polymorphism to simplify how to get data.
4. REST has essentially 5 verbs- GET POST PUT PATCH and DELETE
5. Ruby on Rails helps convert the data into a format that the coder specifies.
