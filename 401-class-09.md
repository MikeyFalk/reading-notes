# Read: 09 - LINQ & Delegates

## LINQ: 
LINQ - Language Integrated Query allows you to integrate a query directly into C#. LINQ offers a number of advantages because you don't have to learn a new query language for different data sources.
LINQ is able to query SQL databases, XML docs and various web services using the same query expressions and syntax for all of them.

When setting up a LINQ Query Opertation there are 3 parts 

1. obtain data source
2. create query 
3. execute the query

LINQ query uses some of the same expressions as a SQL query (`select`, `from`, and `where`). However the order is different. 
In LINQ you start with from to identify where you will look. 
Then you add the filter with the Where clause. This is a boolean value so its a good idea to think where x is true.
Then you define what you want with the select clause.

Like SQL you can also use group, order, and join the data in the query.

`group` will create a list of lists and each object will have a key that the list is grouped under.

`orderby` will return elements sorted alphabetically for strings or numerically for numbers. 

`join` allows you to combine data from multiple sources
