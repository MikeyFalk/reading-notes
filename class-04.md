# Code 201 Reading Notes Day 4

## HTML

### Chapter 4: "Links" (pp. 74 - 93)

* creating links between pages
* linking to other sites
* email links
links move user from one page to another
* created with the `<a>` element 
* `<a>` element uses `href` to indicate page you are linking to 
* use relative urls when linking to pages on your own site
* links can open email with an email address in the to field
* you can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to 

### Chapter 15: "Layout" (pp. 358 - 404)

* layouts -  how you control where everything sits on a page
* `<div>` used as containers to group sections together
* browsers use normal flow unless code specifies relative, absolute, or fixed
* float moves content to left or right and can be used for multi-column
* pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy)
* designers keep pages within 960-1000 px 
* grids create professional and flexible designs
* CSS frameworks -rules for common tasks
* you can have multiple CSS files in one page


## JS

### Chapter 3 (1st part): "Functions, Methods, and Objects" (pp.86- 99 Only)

* Functions: series of statements grouped together to perform a specific task  
* methods: essentially functions inside an object
* objects: create models of the worl usign data made up of properties and methods
* functions can be called only when a specific thing happens user clicks on a part of the page.
* code block: statements inside curly braces
* parameters: information provided to the function to do something i.e size of a box
* return value - what a funciton returns to you if expected to 
function needs to be called to run
* function consists of  keyword, function name, () {code block 1; code block 2; etc.}
* calling the function to execute code in {} can be done with one line of code
* sometimes a function can be called before it is declared
* parameters: information that the function needs to run are included in the () after the function name
* parameters values are called arguments
* arguments can be specific values in the code or can be variables
* functions can return information to the code when they perform a calculation and return the result
* functions can use an array to return multiple values
* There can be anonymous functions
* IIFE (iffy) Immediately Invoked Function Expressions: executed as soon as the interpreter reads them 
* Variable's scope - location of where a variable is declared will affect where it can be used. if declared in a function it can only be used in the function.
* local vs global variables - 
* local is function level global is outside of a function
* global takes up more memory 

**you should use local wherever possible reduces chances of naming conflict.**

## Article: "6 Reasons for Pair Programming"

* Pair Programming: "two heads are better than one" - practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a conding task together. Code Fellows does this to foster a collaborative enviroment and develop key industry skiils.

* Navigator = big picture not touching the computer
* Driver = coder types code switch files, version control

* 4 fundamental skills in coding 
    1. Listeing 
    2. Speaking
    3. Reading 
    4. Writting

* Why 
1. greater efficiency: takes longer but results in better product
2. engaged collaboration: makes coders more focused and helps coders know when to ask for help
3. Learning from fellow students: exposed to new techniques. teaching and learning teaching provide mastery and less experienced students benefit from the knowledge from the more advanced student
4. Social skills: develop interpersonal skills
5. job interview readiness: many interviews include paired programming
6. Work Enviroment Readiness: most companies use pairing when onboarding
