# Read: 04 - Classes & Objects

## Classes 
declared  using the keyword `class`
not nested classes can be public or internal and ar internal by default
all classes can be public, protected internal protected, internal, private or private protected

Classes are declared by using the class keyword followed by a unique identifier

`class` keyword is preceded by the access level 
name of the class follows the class keyword.
rest is class body where behavior and data are defined. 

Fields, properties, methods, and events on a class are class members.

Class and Objects are different. Class defines an object but is not an object itself
## Constructors
When a class or struct is created a constructor is called. Constructors enable the programmer to set default values, limit instantiation, and write code that is flexible and easy to read.

if you don't provide a constructor for your class, C# creates one by default 

A constructor is a method whose name is the same as the name of its type. its method signature includes only the method name and parameter list. does not include a return type. 

## Properties
A property is a member that provides a flexible mechanism to read write or compute the value of a private field

get - return the property value 
set - assign a new value

properties can be read-write read-only or write-only

backing fields - for setting and retrieving the property value

## Stack and Heap
where .NET stores items in memory as code executes
 
Stack - responsible for keeping track of what's executing in our code
Heap - responsible for keeping of objects(data)


## Garbage Collection Fundamentals
Benefits:
frees developers from having to manually release memory
Allocates objects on the managed heap efficiently
reclaims objects that are no longer being used clears their memory and keeps the memory available for future allocation.
Provides memory safety by making sure that an object cannot use the content of another object

fundamentals of memory:
Each process has its own separate virtual address
on 32-bit computers each process has a 2 gb user mode virtual address space
app developers on work with virtual address space
