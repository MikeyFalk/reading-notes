## The Call Stack defined on MDN

- call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in script that calls multiple functions.

- when the script calls a function the interpreter adds it to the call stack
- later functions are added to the stack
- functions that are completed are taken off the stack
- if the stack takes more space than is assigned to it the result is a stack overflow.



## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

- The call stack is used for function invocation (call). Functions are done one at a time from top to bottom. or synchronous.

- Asynchronous Javascript uses a callback function and event loop and a task queue. The callback function is acted upon by the call stack during execution after the call back function has been passed to the stack by the event loop.

- call stack is a data structure that uses last in first out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation.

- Manage function invocation: the stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (removed after execution)

- Stack Overflow: occurs when a function that calls itself w/o an exit point. the browser has a max number or stack calls before it throws the error.

## JavaScript error messages

### Types of error messages

- reference errors - trying to use a variable that is not yet declared. fix is to declare the variable before any declaration is made.

- syntax errors - something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax. For example check for `"` vs `'` for a JSON.parse.

- Range Errors - Trying to manipulate an object and giving it an invalid length. For example an array cannot have a negative length. Its best to avoid mutating variables.

- Type errors - passing a string when a number is expected. To fix make sure the variable exists before trying to access it.

### Debugging

- `Console.log()` the variables you want to check in the console window.

- Open the console and click on the line you want to debug and refresh the page. Then you can see what happened after the refresh so you can see the output and make sure the variable are what you think they are.

- add a breakpoint by putting a debugger statement in the line of code you want to debug.
This can also be done in VS Code.

- Use Try and Catch as well which throws an error with an error message that can be customized.
