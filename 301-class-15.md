History: Silicon Valleyâ€™s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago

Quartz article focused on reviewing the history of the gender gap in tech fields.

In the early 70s and 80s te gap was closer 37% of CS grad were women but in 2016 only 18% were women.

Elizabeth Ames argues that the gender gap was created because of the relationship between gaming and computing in the 1980s and the games were aimed more towards boys than girls.

in 1985 73% of men used a computer on a weekly basis vs 45% of women.

Studies show that more early exposure to engineering and computing creates more positive attitudes toward interest in STEM subjects.

The existing male-dominated gender gap creates a obstacle to entry for women.

The advertising narrative around women and technology needs to be more inclusive to help close the gender gap. 

Data:
Interesting data visualization of gender and ethnicity breakdown percentages in top tech companies. I was surprised by Amazon's breakout and wonder if the numbers used in the graphs include all workers (ie warehouse to management). The reason why is my experience was working with a much more diverse workforce than what is represented on the chart. If the numbers do include warehouse works that would explain the difference.
