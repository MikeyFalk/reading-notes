# Graphs

Graphs are a non-linear data structure. People will describe graphs as having vertices (nodes) connected by edges which are line segments.
It is possible to have a graph with nodes that don't have edges.

There are several types of graphs that are used for different practical purposes in programming

Facebook uses an undirected graph for connections between users. An undirected graph is where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. For a social network this makes sense because connections are mutual.  Facebook can make friend recommendations by suggesting connections that are one edge away from current a connection.

Google uses a directed graph or digraph for crawling the web. A digraph works well for this because not every website has a mutual connection. For example many websites may link to wikipedia but wikipedia does not link back to every page that links to it in their articles. 
The edges in a digraph are directed by listing the source vertice first the destination vertice second.

a GPS program uses a weighted graph a weighted graph has values assigned to its edges. This helpful for giving directions because there may be several routes to get to a single place but there are shorter and longer and faster and slower roads to each waypoint in the directions the GPS program weights each edge differently according to these factors.

Queues are used for Breadth First Traversals of graphs similar to trees. (trees are a kind of graph). 

The order for this type of traversal is 
Enqueue the declared start
Start a loop that will run while there are nodes still present
Dequeue the first node
If the eDequed node has unvisited child nodes add the un-visted children to the visited set and insert them into the queue. 

Depth First traversals for graphs are different than what we use for trees. For a graph traversal a stack is used.
push the node into the stack
start a loop while the stack is not empty peek at the top of the stack. If the top node has unvisted children mark the top node as unvisted and then push any unvisited children back into the stack. If the top node does not have any unvisited children pop that node off the stack and repeat until the stack is empty
