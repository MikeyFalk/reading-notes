# View Compnents

## Intro to View Components

View Components are basically a way to insert little sections that can pull data from various models into a view or razor page.
 
Similar to partial views, but more powerful.

Often used for: 
Dynamic navigation menus
tag cloud
login panel 
shopping cart

components are derived from 2 parts - the class and the result it returns
