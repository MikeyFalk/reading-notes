# MVC Forms

## View Models
The view handles the app's data presentation and user interaction in a MVC Model-View-Controller pattern.

A view is an HTML template with Razor Markup 

Views are .cshtml files and are grouped into folders that match the naming convention of the app's controllers. For example the home folder for views with a home root should match the homecontroller. 

layouts are used to provide consistent webpage sections
partial views manage reusable parts of views.
view components are like partial views which reduce repetitive code, but are used when content requires database interaction and aren't limited to model binding

views establish a separation of concerns by separating user interface from other parts of the app.

Tag Helpers add server-side behavior to HTML tags.  

IntelliSense can help you to see properties of a viewmodel. To do this type the variable name for the viewmodel followed by a period
