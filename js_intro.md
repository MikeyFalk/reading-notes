# JS Demo

- HTML = structure
- CSS = decoration
- JS = power makes page interactive. 
    - Exercise to add feature that will tell the user good morning, good afternoon, and good evening based on time of day

 - JS uses var to store information coder will give the var a name 
    - **pro tip** give the var an easy to understand name i.e. UserName not "a"

- Keep JS script in a seperate file and coder needs to tell reference the file in the index.html file 
- We also created a seperate HTML file in to reference the JS file JS files go in JS folders.
- Coder can place the JS script directly in the HTML page but best practice is to keep the script in its own file
