## C# OOP Anaologies

### Inheritance:

Inheritance is the ability to specialize a base class using a derived class. An analogy would be the base class is motor vehicle and the derived classes could be motorcycle, car, and SUV. They all share the basic declarations with the base class like motor and wheels, but the derived classes add members that define specific types of motor vehicles.  

Abstract: partial base class that that requires derived class to be complete, Like going to a build-a-bear store there are different color bears and clothes on the shelf and the customer decides which combo to put together. The parts on the shelf before being built are abstract classes.

Sealed: classes that cannot be derived in other classes. Kind of like when you hear "Any other use of this telecast or any pictures, descriptions, or accounts of the game without the NFL's consent is prohibited" before an NFL game.


### Polymorphism: 

The class declared type can change after run time. This is like a chameleon or octopus which is always a chameleon or octopus object, but depending on it surroundings can be a different color or texture. 


### OOP Principles: 

**4 Principles - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation** - What makes OOP powerful is that once an object is built it can be modified to suit many deferent needs. The example in the reading uses a bank account with may have a line of credit a savings account and a gift card all powered off the same base class. It reminded me of the 7 in 1 air fryer I got for christmas this year. A single unit can air fry bake, broil, proof, defrost etc. with a slight change in the settings or adjustment of the grates in the unit.
