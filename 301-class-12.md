### EJS Partials

- handy for reusing the same HTML across multiple views. (ie footers, menus and navs)
- best practice to include a partials directory in the views directory - the partial you want to re-use is stored in its own file (i.e navbar.ejs for a nav bar used across your site)
- another good example use case is footer.ejs
- use `<%- include('<PARTIAL FILE PATH AND NAME HERE>') %>`>
