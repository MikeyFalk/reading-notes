# Claims and JWT tokens

### Claims-Based auth

Claims are name value pairs that represent what a subject is not what they can do.
The are issued by a trusted party.
Claims based authorization checks the value of the claim and allows access based on the claim.
A good analogy would be getting into a bar the claim is the date of birth on your drivers license and the bouncer checks that claim and determines if you are 21 and if the issuer is trusted.
You can't use a library card but a drivers license or a passport would be a trusted source.  

developer build and register a policy to implement claims based authorization.
Authorization service configuration is usually added in the startup.cs file under the `configureServices()` method block. 

After building and and registering the policy you can add the policy to an entire controller or to a specific route using annotations 
`[Authorize(Policy = "PolicyX')]`

If the entire controller is protected by `[Authorize]` then you can allow access to specific routes using the `[allowAnonymous]` attribute
If multiple policies are applied that all policies must pass before access it granted.


custom policy handlers like evaluate a date of birth to determine access can also be created:

### Intro to Claims

Authentication vs Authorization 
Authentication = determine who you are 
Authorization = determine what you can do

Authentication is required before authorization because need to know who you are before we can determine what you can do. 

Identity may have many claims against it `FirstName`,`LastName`, `DateofBirth` etc.
but they are about who you are not what you can do.

A single identity or principal may have and have to provide multiple claims to gain access.
The analogy used in the reading is taking a flight. You use your passport to prove who you are at the check in counter then you use your ticket and passport to get through security then you need to provide a VIP number and passport to get into the VIP lounge and if you are missing any of the claims you are denied entry.


### JWT Authentication

JWT stands for JSON Web Token - represents claims to be transferred between two parties.

They are signed by a JSON Web Signature (JWS) and encrypted using JSON Web Encryption (JWE)

JWTs have 3 parts Header Payload and Signature.

The Header has an `alg` and a `typ`

The alg is used to indicate the algorithm used in the signature so that the consumer and producer use the same algorithm.   

typ defines the type of token it is ie JWT.

The payload contains the claims. Using the airport example this would be date of birth, first name, last name, and citizenship on a passport.  

The Signature use the base64url encoding of the header and payload and encrypts it with the secret key.

The 2 parties involved in JWT Token are producer and consumer
producer gives a service In this case the server of the APIs to be protected  and consumer uses it. In this case the client who provides the JWT token to consume the APIs.
