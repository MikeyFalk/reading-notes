## File and Stream I/O 
- Refers to the transfer of data either to a or from a storage medium.
- file is an ordered and named collection of bytes that has persistent storage.
- (directory paths, disk storage, file and directory names)
- - A stream is a sequence of bytes that you can use to read from and write to a backing store
  - (disks or memory, network, memory and pipe streams)
  -  
- you can get and set properties for files and directories ans retrieve collections based on search criteria.

Commonly used file and directory classes:
- File - static method for creating, copying, deleting, moving and opening files.
- FileInfo - provides instance methods for ''. helps create a file stream object.
- Directory - static methods for creating moving and enumerating through directories and sub-directories
- Directory Info - provides instance methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories and sub-directories
- Path - provides methods and properties for processing directory strings in a cross-platform manner

##### robust exception handling for filesystem methods is a best practice.

#### Streams 
3 operations Reading, Writing, and Seeking
commonly used stream classes
- FileStream - reading and writing to a file
- IsolatedStorageFile Stream - for reading and writing to memory as the backing store 
- MemoryStream - for reading and writing to memory as the backing store
- BufferedStream - for improving performance of read and write operations
- NetworkStream - for reading and writing over network sockets
- PipeStream - for reading and writing over anonymous named pipes
- CryptoStream  - for linking data streams to cryptographic transformations

Readers and Writers
reader and writer types handle conversions of encoded characters to and from bytes so the stream and complete the operation

##### Best practice to us Asynchronous operations if application needs to remain responsive to user
- asynchronous members contain Async in their name

#### Compression 
- reduces the size of a file for storage. 
- Decompression extracts the contents for use.

#### Isolated storage
- mechanism to provide isolation and safety by defining standardized ways of associating code with saved data
- can save settings or files that is controlled by the computer's security policy 


## Write to a file
good documentation and sample code on how to write a test to a file.
examples include:
Synchronously write text with StreamWriter
Synchronously append text with StreamWriter
Asynchronously write text with StreamWriter
Write and append text with the File class

## Read to a file

System.IO.BinaryWriter and System.IO.BinaryReader are for data other than character strings
Code sample to writer integers 0 through 10 to test.data and read back at origin with the file pointer.
