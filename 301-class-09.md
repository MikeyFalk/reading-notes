## Functional Programming:

#### Functional Programming Concepts

Functional Programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state of mutable data.

Pure Functions

1. same results if given the same arguments -deterministic
2. no observable side effects

pure functions cannot include reading files or random number generators and should include all the parameters to the function vs allowing global functions.

mutability is discouraged in functional programming - don't alter gloabl variables instead return a value with a new variable.

These practices make every function isolated and unable to impact other parts of the system.

## Benefits

- easier to test

Referential Transparency - a function consistently yields the same result fo the same input

Functions as first-class entities - functions are also treated as values and used as data.
allows us to combine different functions to create new functions with new behavior

Higher-order Functions - a functions that takes in more functions as arguments or returns a function as a result. these include filter, map, and reduce.

#### Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability

Strategies for refactoring:

- Return early from functions
- Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences
- Check for WEB APIs before implementing your own functionality
