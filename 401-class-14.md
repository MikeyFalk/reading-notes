# Routing and Navigation Properties

## Routing within MVC
Routing Modules are responsible for mapping incoming browser requests to controller actions.

Routing is normally setup in the applications Web configuration file.

Essentially the controller has methods that can take in parameters to build the routing. The result of the methods being called is a url.   


## Routing within Core

Routing is matches incoming HTTP requests and dispatches them to the app's executable endpoints. 

Endpoints are units of executable request handling code by extracting values from the request URL and use them to request processing.

Routing uses middleware which is registered in the code with 

`useRouting` - adds routing mapping to mw pipeline
    and 
`useEndpoints` - adds endpoint execution to the mw pipeline.

`MapGet` defines an endpoint.

`HttpContext` - has the endpoints and can be used to inspect its properties.

#### URL Matching

process of routing matching incoming request to an endpoint based on the data in the URL path and headers.

Route template precedence is a system that assigns each rout a value bases on how specific it is 
more segments in the route are more specific. literal text in the route is more specific than a parameter segment. Constraints are more specific than segments without them. Catch all parameters are the least specific.
