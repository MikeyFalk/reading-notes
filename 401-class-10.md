# Read: 10 - Stacks and Queues

## Stacks: 
- A stack is a data structure that is like a linked list because it is like a one way street you have to start at the beginning to access any nodes. 
- Unlike a linked list once the node in a stack is processed it is deleted.
- An good analogy for a stack is like stack of plates you would never pull a plate from the middle of the stack you always pull the top one off.
- Stacks are a LIFO data structure - **Last In First Out**.
- There are several methods used for manipulating stacks all of these are O(1) operations- it will always take the same amount of time no matter how many nodes there are in a stack.



- Push
   `ALOGORITHM push(value)
    // INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
    // OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   node.next <-- Top
   top <-- Node`

- Pop
    `ALGORITHM pop()
    // INPUT <-- No input
    // OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
    // EXCEPTION if stack is empty
   Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value`

- Peek
    `ALGORITHM peek()
    // INPUT <-- none
    // OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
    // EXCEPTION if stack is empty
   return top.value`

- IsEmpty
    `ALGORITHM isEmpty()
    // INPUT <-- none
    // OUTPUT <-- boolean
    return top = NULL` 

## Queues
- A queue is a data structure like a stack that must be traversed one at a time.
- A queue is also like a stack in that once the node is processed it is deleted.
- A queue is different from a stack because it is a FIFO **First In First Out** structure.
- A good analogy for a queue is a line at the store. The first person in line get processed first in order 
- There are several operators used with queues they are and the are all O(1) operations because they all take the same amount of time no matter how many nodes are in the stack.

- Enqueue - add a node to the back of the queue
    `ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
    // INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
    // OUTPUT <-- none
    node = new Node(value)
    rear.next <-- node
    rear <-- node`

- Dequeue - remove a node from the front of the queue
    `ALGORITHM dequeue()
    // INPUT <-- none
    // OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
    // EXCEPTION if queue is empty
   Node temp <-- front
   front <-- front.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value`


- Peek - inspect the node at the front of the queue.
    `ALGORITHM peek()
    // INPUT <-- none
    // OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue
    // EXCEPTION if Queue is empty
   return front.value`

- isEmpty - returns a bool value depending on what is in the queue.
    `ALGORITHM isEmpty()
    // INPUT <-- none
    // OUTPUT <-- boolean
    return front = NULL`
