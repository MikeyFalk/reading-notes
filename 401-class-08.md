# Read: 08 - Collections & Enums

## Collections: 

Collections are like arrays of objects except they are more flexible because collections can grow and shrink. Arrays have to have a pre-determined length.
Objects in Collections have to be all the same type of object. 
Objects in collection have a 0 based `[index]` value like an array.

There are several kinds of collections:

System.Collections.Generic classes - useful for objects that are all the same data type.
Dictionary -  has key value pairs
List -objects accessed by index
Queue - First In First OutFIFO
SortedList - key value pairs that can be sorted. Uses the IComparer  
Stack  - Last in First Out 

System.Collection.Concurrent classes
ArrayList - array of objects whose size can be increased
Hashtable - collection of key/value pairs organized based on hash code of the key 
Queue - FIFO
Stack - LIFO


System.Collections classes

`foreach` loops can be used to add objects to a collection. 


## Enums

Enums are a way to represent a set of specific values or combination of choices.  

Its kind of like how you handle a two year old child. You want to help them assert their independence (and make your life easier) so you want to give them a choice to make but you want to limit their options to something are willing and can support.
For example, in the morning I will ask my son if he wants frozen waffles, oatmeal, or pancakes for breakfast because they can all be put together quickly and I know I have the ingredients to make all those items. If I gave him an open ended choice like "what do you want for breakfast?" he may respond with something like hamburgers which I don't have the ingredients or the time to make before class starts. 
I guess basically I'm giving my child enums for breakfast choices.
