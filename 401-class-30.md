# Hash Tables

Hashtables or Hashmaps are a data structure that uses hashing to determine the index of the bucket where a key value pair is stored. When more than one key hashes to the same value a collision occurs. One way to handle a collision is to create a linked list of key value pairs in the bucket at that index.

Hashing - is process of turning a string into an integer value. A common way to hash is to either multiply or add the ascii values of the letters in the string multiply that by a prime number like 599. Use Modulo `%` to find the remainder.  

Once you have hash value you insert the key value pair into a bucket at that index in the table or map.

Buckets are containers that are identified by an index of an array. The bucket can be null or hold 1 or more key value pairs.

Collisions occur when more than 1 key hashes to the same value so the key value pairs are inserted into the bucket in the table.

The advantage to using a hash table is that arrays are quick to navigate when you have the index.

To borrow John' analogy of the difference between asking each person at a Seahawk's game if they are John vs asking over the loudspeaker for John to stand up. Finding a key value pair in a hash table is like knowing which row John's season ticket are in and going to that row and asking each person in the row if the are John.
