# Read: 02 - Unit Testing and Documentation

## Unit Testing Best Practices *Not in Xunit, but concepts are still true
 - Unit testing has become mainstream over the last 15 years
 
Unit Testing is:
 - Isolate and exercise specific units of your own code
 - In C# a unit = method
 - Frameworks exist for unit tests
 - Should name tests intuitively 

- Best Practices
  - Arrange, Act, Assert
  - One Assert Per Test Method
  - Avoid Test Interdependence
  - Short Sweet and Visible
  - If the Test is difficult to set try something else
  - Add to the build

## Art of Readme

- Readmes are helpful for making sure that code lasts - even if you don't plan to share you can use them when you go back to code you have't looked at in a while to see what is going on.
- good readmes keep developers out of the source code because they explain what the module does.
- the readme is the first impression the consumer gets of your code
- the should 
  - tell them what it is ( add context)
  - show them what it lookd like in action
  - show them how they use it
  - tell them any relevant details
  - keep it succinct
  - use a predictable format
  - make sure certain key elements are present
