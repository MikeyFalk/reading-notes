## Sending Form Data

- What happens to data when a form is submitted

web browser sends a request to a server then the server answers the request using the same protocol.

- the `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent
- most important are `action` and `method`

- `action` - defines where the data gets sent. value must be a valid relative or absolute url. If not defined the data will be sent to the url of the page containing the form (i.e. the current page).

names and values are sent to the server as name=value pairs joined with ampersands

- `method` - defines how data is sent using HTTP protocol. Most common is `GET` and `POST`.

- `GET` method is used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource. This has an empty body.
- `POST` method is used by the browser to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request. Data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.

- To view HTTP requests you can use Developer tools on chrome
    1. Open developer tools
    2. Select "network"
    3. Select "All"
    4. Select ".com" in the "Name" tab
    5. Select "Headers"

- Never use the `GET` method to send sensitive information (ie passwords)
- Large amounts of data should use the `POST` method

- Server Side

    Server receives a string that will be parsed to get a list of key/value pairs. Access depends on specific frameworks you are working in (ie PHP, Python). Will work with Express for Node.js

- Sending Files:
    
    files are binary data and there are special requirements.

- enctype attribute - allows you to specify the value of the `content-type`. Header is important because it tells the what kind of data is being sent.

- Security Issues:

    issues come from how the server handles the data

- how to avoid
    1. Escape potentially dangerous characters
    2. Limit the incoming amount of data to what is necessary
    3. Sandbox uploaded files.
