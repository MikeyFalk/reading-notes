## 1. Data Models (Review the DB Schema)

Database Schema is like a blueprint of how the database is constructed.

Data annotation attributes can fix the display format.
    - in the .cs file you can add a `using  System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;` statement at the top of the page.
- `DataType` attribute specifies the data type.
- `StringLength` sets maximum length.
- `RegularExpression`- sets restrictions to the input
- `MaxLength` - similar to `StringLength` but without client side validation 

- `using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema`  
    - this allows the user to use attributes that control how classes and properties are mapped to the database.

## 2. DBMS

DBMS stands for Data Base Management System - 

- The advantages of DBMS is using realistic real-world entities in its architecture design.
    - for example in a school database you can use students as an entity.
- It uses relation based tables - This allows a user to understand relationships just be looking at the table names. The school might have a table called students and another called classes.
- Isolation of data and application the systems is different from its data. DBMS also stores metadata which is data about data.
- Normalization - splits a relation when there are redundancy in attribute values.
- Consistency - every relation in the table is consistent
- Query Language - can be used to apply filters when retrieving data.   
- multiuser and concurrent access multiple users can access the data at the same time
- multiple views - views can be different based on a user role. Sales will see a views specific to sales and buyer will see a view specific their role.
- Security - DBMS can be compartmentalized so access to sensitive data input and views can be limited by role and permissions.

## 3. Do some research on what a Database Schema is.

### What is a Schema?
 - A schema is a blueprint of how the database is constructed
### Why do we use them?
 - It helps programmers whose software will interact with the database 

### What do they look like?
    - schemas look like a tree that diagrams the relationship between tables and column headers 

## 4. What are the different types of Database Keys?
   - 
### What is a Primary Key?
 - ensures the data in a specific column is unique. This helps the user make sure they are using the right data if there are duplicate values in multiple rows

### What is a Foreign Key?
 - the foreign key is used in relational database tables to reference the link between data in two tables. 

### What is a Composite Key?
 - a key made up of two or more columns that when put together identify an entity 
  
### How are they different? When do you use 1 over the others?
- a primary key is used to identify an entity entry in a single table. A foreign key is used to link data for the entity across multiple tables for example if you had a school database there may be a table with students and a table with class information. Because the tables should be separate (there are multiple students in the same class so keeping class data in the student table would mean too much duplicate data in one table) The student table might refer to the class table by a foreign key this will allow a use to write a query that will join the to tables and pull the data into a single output.
- A composite key would be like using firstname and lastname in a table of students. Since many people might have the same first name using both names allows the user to identify a single person.

## 5. What are Relationships in a relational database?

### What is a 1:1 relationship?
- one row in a table may be linked with only one row in another table for example a table with countries and a table with capitals.

### What is a Many:Many relationship?
- when multiple records in table are linked to multiple records in another table. A good example of this would be if you have a products table and a customers table. many customer might purchase the same product and a single product may be purchased by multiple customers.

### How about a 1: Many or a Many:1?
- these occur when a single record in a table has a relationship to many records in another table. For example a customer account may have a reference to many orders over time in an orders table.
