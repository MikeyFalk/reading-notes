# Dependency Injection & Repository Patterns

## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection is a software design pattern used to achieve an IOC (Inversion of control between classes).

IOC is used to plug in interfaces at run time fairly easy. This helps enforce the single responsibility principle because each class will only do one thing. This makes unit testing easier and allows changes to the code to happen in a single place (ie switch out where the API calls can be done with a single line of code).

DI is used to change teh implementation of the controller wihtout modifying the controller itself.

Dependencies can be be chained together.

Services in DI are an object that provide service to other objects and not related to a weservice

## Repository Pattern

Repositories are like intermediaries between the model and data mapping layers an seperate the dependency between the work domain and the data allocation

Repositories should be the only way you update the database this protects your data's integrity and prevents issues from poor code messing up you database.

Repositories make it easier to test logic with unit tests.

## Repository Design Pattern

Repositories are based on CRUD methods Create, Read, Update and Delete.

One repository pattern is the Data Access Object or DOA. When building DOAs, keep thinks small, simple, and consistent.

Keep them consistent across all classes to make them easier to read and work with.

DOAs are a way to work with data without needing to work about the source of the data.
## SOLID Principles, Why SOLID Matters, and SOLID Principles in Pictures 

SOLID is an acronym that is used as a mnemonic device to remember the principles of clean code.
S - Single Reponsibility Principle - Each class or method on your code should only have one job.
O - Open/Close Principle - software should be open to extention but closed to modification. If you build a robot and want it to be able to cut things you should give it different tools to cut with (pizza slicer class or chainsaw class) instead of modifying the robot. This allows the robot to be extended.
L - Liskov Sunstitution Principle - an object in your app should be able to be replaced with a type derived from it without breaking the application. A class dervied from a bread maker should be able to offer a type of bread (whole wheat) not flour.
I - The Interface Segregation Principle - Interfaces need to be specific and fine grained instead of generalized.
D - Dependency Inversion Principle - Code should rely on abstractions and coupling should be as loose as possible. When writting software that uses a database don't make it dependent on a single type of database.
