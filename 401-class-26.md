## MVC Basics

MVC - Model View Controller Model is a design pattern which is more efficient than compared with traditional ASP.NET Web Application

MVC is action-based architecture - an appropriate view is displayed based on the action 

MVC response time is less than ASP.NET because there is no page lifecycle when a request is made it hits the controller which hits the action controller collects data from the model and its sent to the view 

MVC is better suited to test driven development because the UI and the action logic are loosely coupled and can be tested separately

MVC can be easily adjusted for mobile  because you can just change the view.

## Tag Helpers
Tag Helpers enable server-side code to create and render HTML elements in Razor files

Advantages:
HTML friendly development experience - if you know HTML/CSS/JavaScript you can edit Razor easily
IntelliSense Environment - IntelliSense works with tag Helpers making it easier to write the code. 
ImageTagHelper reduce chances for mistakes stale images or incorrect strings with images


use `addTagHelper` at the top of a view page give teh developer access to the tag helpers
you will also need to add _ViewImports.cshtml file to enable them.
