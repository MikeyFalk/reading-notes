# Data Transfer Objects

### Data Transfer Objects:

DTOs are objects that define how data will be sent over. We use this because pulling the data straight out of a database an passing to a client may not be the best strategy. You may want to hide certain fields or omit data or decouple the service layer from the database layer.

### How to Use DTOs:

Why: You don't want to expose internal data structures of your application.
DTO's allow you to decouple the layers

DTOs can be used to abstract the domain objects you can change the backend without having to update the code on the front end. 

You can protect parts of your data while using others. For example providing a list of employees is useful to multiple people in the company, but only HR should see their salaries using a DTO you can provide different slices of the data.
