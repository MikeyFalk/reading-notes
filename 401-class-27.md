## Claims-Based auth

One or more claims are assigned when an identity is created. Claims are name value pairs that represent what the subject is. Claims based authorization checks the value of the claim and allows access based on the value.

claims are declarative and are embedded in code against a controller or in an action within a controller and spcifies the claims which the user must possess

Claims are policy based and are built into and register a policy with the claims requirements.

## Intro to Claims

Authentication is the process of determining who you are 
Authorization is what you can do.

You can't authorize anything without authenticating a user first.

Claims are about what or who the identity is like date of birth,  first name, or email address.

Identity can have multiple claims against it like a driver's license which has date of birth, first name, last name and address on it.

Users can have multiple identities and these are all wrapped up in the ClaimsPrincipal. This is like having a driver's license, passport, and boarding pass.

## JWT Authentication

JWT or JSON Web Token represents claims transferred between 2 parties. They are digitally signed by JWS JSON Web Signature and encrypted using JWE JSON Web Encryption.

Parts of a JWT Token - Header, Payload, Signature

The header has 2 parts the alg and typ 

alg - there are 2 main algorithms for sign a JWT  HS256 and RS256 this is so both the producer and consumer both use the same algorithm to verify the token.
typ - tells the type of token being used

The payload contains custom and standard claims 

standard claims include the issuer, subject, audience, expiration and not before times, Issued at and JWT ID

The Signature is calculated by the base64url encoding of the header and payload concatenated with a period as a separator 

the 2 parties involved are the producer and consumer

the producer is the one who gives the service and the consumer is the one who uses it.
