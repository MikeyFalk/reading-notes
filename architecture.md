# Computer Architecture & Logic

### How computers work

- Only 4 basic tasks

1. input
2. storage
3. processing
4. output

- computers started a basic calculators were huge and slow modern computer do same basic tasks but are everywhere phone, watch, or car
- algotithm - series of comands to manipulate input and stores it until ready for outpu
- internet output from one computer is input for another computer

### Data & Binary

- computers work on ones and zeros
- inside are circuits signal is either on or off
- bits (yes no, true false, 1 or 0)
- binary system different from decimal multiples by 2 instaed of 10
- 32 wires can store over 4 billion
- can represent text, images, and sound

### Circuits and Logic

- circuits tiny electrical componets
- circuits that flip a signal are called 'not'
- circuits that take 2 signals and only when both signals are 1 give a 1 output are and circuts
- multiple circuits create logic gates
- all simple math (addition and subtraction)


### Memory, CPU, Input & Output

- input device mic or keyboard letter B sends binary
- CPU calculates how to dsplay letter pixel by pixel accepts binary
- CPU requests from memory how to construct the letter
- CPU sends teh pixel to memeory
- memory sends pixels to monitor to display the letter

### Hardware and Software

- software is code
- hardware are wires circuits chips plugs speakers
- CPU is master chip controls computer
- CPU has to know which circuit to use and how to use it
- software tells the CPU what to do
- OS master program that manages how software uses the hardware of the computer
- OS switches between many programs to look like its running multiple programs at once
