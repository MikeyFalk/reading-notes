# Trees

Trees are a data structure where nodes are linked hierarchically. visually they look similar to a family tree. 

Binary Search Trees or BSTs are sorted if the value is less it will be on the left if the value is more it will be on the right.

BSTs make search delete and insert faster because they use LogN - basically you keep dividing in half until you find what you are looking for or only have one value left and if that value is not what you are looking for then you are done searching.

The beginning of the tree is a root an and nodes that brach from that root are called children. if a node doesn't have any children it is called a leaf.

the links between the two nodes in a tree are called edges and if you want to find the height of the tree you can count the edges between the root and the furthest leaf this can be a different value than the number of nodes so it's important to point that out.

There are basically 3 ways to traverse a tree 

Pre-order - first get the data  then go left then go right or D>>L>>R

In-order - first go left get the data then go right  or L>>D>>R.

Post-order - first go left then go right then get the data or L>>R>>D.

Trees are usually traversed with recursive method.
