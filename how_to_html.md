# Website Structure

## HTML

### **Remember** *when using github html file needs to be named* **index.html**.

GitHub looks for this filename to find HTML not just the file extention 

- HTML is the foundation / bones (words on the page and location) of the website
- CSS is the decoration (i.e. style, layout, font, etc.)
- JS adds functionality (i.e. forms)
- HTML uses tags to define directions to the browser and in the tags are the words and images that appear on the page
- tags have an open and close and appear in '<''>' symbols

## Building a Website

- start with the wireframe to define the structure
- name the elements of the wireframe for easy refrence when writing HTML
- Start with the larger elements and get more specific (i.e. start with head, main, footer - move to headers and sections, then paragraphs, lists and images)
- use google to research tags there are many to choose from!
