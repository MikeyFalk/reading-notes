 # Operators & Loops

 ## Comparison and logical operators
 - Comparison operators are used to evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you might expect it might be. The result is a Boolean: True or False.

 `==` is equal to compares just the 2 values
 `!=` is not equal to
 `===` is strict equal to - checks both if both value and type are the same
 `!==` is strict not equal to
 `>` is greater than
 `<` is less than
 `>=` is greater than or equal to
 `<=` is less than or equal to

 - Logical Operators
- Logical Operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator
`&&` logical and
`||` logical or
`!` logical not

 ## `for` and `while` loops

 - Loops check a condition. If it returns true a code block will run then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns a true then the condition will be checked again. It repeats until the condition returns a false.

 - for loops run the check a specific number of times

`for (var i = 0; i < 10; 1++){`
    `document.write (i);`
    `}`
 
 - while loops run for an unspecified amount of time until the condition returns false
- make sure to have question in body of while when the condition is true or it will run forever
