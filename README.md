*This site is a repository of my reading notes for my code fellows classes. I'll be actively updating this site throughout my journey so check back frequently to get the latest updates!*

## My Bio

My name is Mike. I live in Seattle with my wife, son, cat and dog. I love to cook, ski, ride bicyclces, play golf, read and listen to music - not all at the same time. I recently "retired" from Amazon after 13 years to learn how to code. After spending so much time working with tech teams in my product and program roles I decided to jump the fence to the other side. I wanted to learn how to build the tools and solutions instead of requesting them in requirements documents.
