RWD - responsive web design

mobile is outpacing desktop usage for access to the web this affects how we need to build websites.

RWD is the practice of building websites that work on every screen size mobile, tablet, desktop etc.

responsive vs adapative

responsive - react quickly and positively to any change. fluidly change based on viewport width  
adaptive - easily modified for a new purpose or situation. built to preset factors.

A combo of the two is ideal.

RWD uses flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media.

flexible grid layout that can resize to any width using em or percentages units.

relative units can be used to size elements on a page that can flex proportionally.

this works well but some veiwports are so small that it will still break the page.

media queries help alleviate that issue.

media queries allow you to specify different styles for individual browsers and device circumstances

best practice to use the `@media` using the `@import` rule inside an existing style sheet

media features

most commonly used media features - height and width media features determine the size for a device or browser viewport.
features can be prefixed with min or max qualifiers 

orientation - determines if a device is in the landscape or portrait orientation.

Mobile First - use styles targetted at smaller viewpoorts as the default styles for a website then use media querries to add styles as the viewport grows.
doing this reduces the need for a mobile device to download styles that will only be used by a browser.

Make sure to also add flexible media (pictures and video)
this can be done with setting the `max-width` property with a value of 100% this will ensure media will scale down according to its container width.
