## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

    The article describes what Julia Rozovsky a researcher at Google found in her quest to find out what makes good teams good. This was part of her work on the 3 year long project Aristotle. 

    Basically google wanted to find what they could measure that would detemine if a team was successful. In today's work enviroment working in a group and with others is impossible to escape and Google wanted to be able to measure the factors that made a succcessful team so they could repeat the process.

    What they found is that all the traditional measures for individual efficiency and personal performance did not apply to the team setting. 

    Much of what makes a team perform well are really the 'unwritten rules' of the team dynamics. EQ, the ability to read what a person felt through the way body language and facial expression and other nonverbal communication was more important than individual IQs. 

    Finally, in order to improve a team's EQ everyone on the team needed to  be comfortable and feel psychologically safe to share ideas without fear of being rejected. 

    There are several ways to achieve this 1. discuss the importance of the team's contribution to the whole 2. review team surveys to open dialogue on what needs to improve and address them as a group 3. open up personally (a person can't put on a work persona anymore).

    Open question not in the reading, but was in my mind: We get alot of nonverbal queues when we are present in the room with others, but covid has pushed us to interactions only over zoom meetings what are some tools that we can use to improve our ability to pick up on these nonverbal queues in addition to turning video on?
