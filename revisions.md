* version control alllows users to share with others and online back up
* be careful of merge conflicts 
    * merge conflicts occur when changes are made in multiple locations to avoid only work in vs code and push changes to git hub.
* ACP add commit push process to save work back to master
* Remember to save in text editor often or turn on auto save feature
