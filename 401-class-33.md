To wire up email refer to the following sample code to create an email object:
`var msg = new SendGridMessage();`

`msg.SetFrom(new EmailAddress("dx@example.com", "SendGrid DX Team"));`

`var recipients = new List<EmailAddress>`
`{
    new EmailAddress("jeff@example.com", "Jeff Smith"),`
 `   new EmailAddress("anna@example.com", "Anna Lidman"),`
  `  new EmailAddress("peter@example.com", "Peter Saddow")`
`};`
`msg.AddTos(recipients);`

`msg.SetSubject("Testing the SendGrid C# Library");`

`msg.AddContent(MimeType.Text, "Hello World plain text!");`
`msg.AddContent(MimeType.Html, "<p>Hello World!</p>");`

Then add the API key in app settings:

`},
  "SENDGRID_API_KEY": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}`

In start up include the sendgrid service by adding the following line of code in the `ConfigureServices` method

 `    public IConfigurationRoot Configuration { get; }`

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Add mvc here
        services.AddMvc();
        services.AddSingleton<IConfiguration>(Configuration);
    }`

Then in the controller you can use the following sample code to send email to multiple recipients.

`namespace SendgridMailApp.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class NotificationController : Controller
    {
       private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;`

       public NotificationController(IConfiguration configuration)
       {
         _configuration = configuration;
       }

       [Route("SendNotification")]
       public async Task PostMessage()
       {
          var apiKey = _configuration.GetSection("SENDGRID_API_KEY").Value;
          var client = new SendGridClient(apiKey);
          var from = new EmailAddress("test1@example.com", "Example User 1");
          List<EmailAddress> tos = new List<EmailAddress>
          {
              new EmailAddress("test2@example.com", "Example User 2"),
              new EmailAddress("test3@example.com", "Example User 3"),
              new EmailAddress("test4@example.com","Example User 4")
          };

          var subject = "Hello world email from Sendgrid ";
          var htmlContent = "<strong>Hello world with HTML content</strong>";
          var displayRecipients = false; // set this to true if you want recipients to see each others mail id 
          var msg = MailHelper.CreateSingleEmailToMultipleRecipients(from, tos, subject, "", htmlContent, false);
          var response = await client.SendEmailAsync(msg);
`     }
   }`
`} `
