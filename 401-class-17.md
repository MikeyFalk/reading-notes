## Razor Pages vs MVC
Razor Pages are new and even though they have a lot of similar architecture as the older MVC model the key difference is how a request is routed and rendered.
In the MVC model - routing sends the request to the controller and the controller does the logic and passes the response to views folder.
In the Razor Page model the routing sends the request directly to the razor page that was intended to handle the request and the razor page handles the request as if it is a controller and doesn't need to locate the View
