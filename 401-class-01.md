# Read: 01 - Exception Handling & Debugging

## Debugging for absolute beginners

 - debugging is running code step by step to in a tool like Visual Studio to find a mistake.
 - debugging tools allow you you to make temporary changes to continue the program.
 - debugging takes practice to get better and is a fundamental skill for any developer.

 1. Clarify the problem by asking the right questions.
    a. What did you expect to happen?
    b. What happened instead?
    c. exception handling can help you identify where the code went wrong. If not use step through to locate the issue.
 2. Examine Assumptions
    a. ask questions to make sure you understand why you expect a certain result.
    b. examples include: right API? Using the API correctly? Check typos. Check last changes to make sure the changes are doing what you expect them to do. Confirm the intent of the code. 
 3. Step through code in debugging mode.
    a. f5 starts debugging in visual studio
    b. you can use breakpoints to pause the program at a specific line.

## Try/Catch Blocks

- use try blocks around any code that might be cause and error or exception 
- use catch blocks to handle the exception 
- include the exception type and additional statements to handle the exception type.
- CLR catches exceptions not handled by catch blocks and: 
    a. Debug box appears
    b. program stops executions and dialog box appears with info.
    c. error prints out to the standard error output stream

## Exception Handling
 
 - throw - `throw [e];` - derived from System.Exception
 - try-catch  - 
 - try-finally 
 - try-catch-finally
